# Habits

Take it for a spin on heroku [here](http://pacific-basin-4904.herokuapp.com)

This is a sample app to keep track of conversations you have had with people(contacts). Be it a client, a boss, legal rep, etc. It lets you track the flow and history of conversations(dialogs) you have been involved in. 

It begins with an encounter via email, phone, in-person, text. The dialog is the discussion from that encounter. Each dialog has a single topic. Each encounter may have several dialogs with seperate topics. Each topic may have several encounters with multiple contacts at seperate times.

You can follow a topic and see all the people involved throughout its lifetime and see who has said what.

This is a work in progress with much work needed, especially in terms of UI. It is functioning, but not intuitive for the user.
